# CS360_Mobile_Architect-Programming
Culmination of work for SNHU's CS-360 Class. 

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app developed, named "Scatterbrain," was designed to manage life events for users encompassing meetings, tests, concerts, appointments, dinner engagements, and more. The primary goal was to create a simple, intuitive, and efficient way to organize and receive notifications for various events. The user needs addressed include the demand for streamlined event management, personalized notifications, collaboration, and security.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app mainly functions off of two screens, the login screen and the main event management screen. All functionlity such as adding or editing events were done by dialog boxes as a way to keep everything centered around the main screen. This also meant that the usability of the app was simplified instead of constantly changing screen for simple tasks. I feeel that this design is succesful as it is simple, yet intuitive and allows for users to accomplish what they need in a single location. Future development would add one more screen as most, such as a full screen calendar to view/plan for upcoming events. 

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The coding process was approached with a clear plan, starting with prototyping and then moving to iterative development. Best practices in mobile app development were used, along with user-centered design principles.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
The Android Emulator within the Android Studio program was heavily relied on for testing the code to ensure viability and functionality. Testing is one of the most vital processes within any kind of software development to identify bugs, inconsistenscies or any areas that are not meeting the product design. Testing can also reveal areas that might need improvement or areas that may have "looked good on paper" but fall short of a good UI/UX. 

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The need to innovate and overcome challenges was constant throughout the development of the application. As stated in the last question, initial design concepts fell short of what the final app was meant to be in terms of UI/UX. Therefore, iterative design and functionality changes were altered in order to produce a more quality product. 

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
One particular success was in the design and implementation of the intuitive user interface, reflecting a strong understanding of user-centered design principles. The combination of aesthetics, usability, and responsiveness demonstrated skill and experience in creating an app that resonates with the target audience.
